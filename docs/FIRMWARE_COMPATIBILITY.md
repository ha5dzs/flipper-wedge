- ❓ Not tested

### Known Issues

#### RogueMaster
- **Type 4/5 NDEF**: Occasional parsing failures on some tags (firmware-specific NFC stack quirks)
- **Dynamic Switching**: ~500ms delay when switching BT→USB (vs ~200ms on other firmwares)
- **Workaround**: Use app restart for output mode changes if dynamic switching is unreliable

#### All Firmwares
- None currently known

## Firmware-Specific Quirks

### Official Firmware
- **NFC Stack**: Most reliable, reference implementation
- **HID**: Standard implementation, no quirks
- **Build System**: Clean builds, no special flags needed

### Unleashed Firmware
- **NFC Stack**: Enhanced NFC support, fully compatible
- **HID**: Same as official
- **Build System**: Slightly longer build times due to additional features

### Momentum Firmware
- **NFC Stack**: Momentum-specific optimizations, compatible
- **HID**: Enhanced BT profile switching
- **Build System**: May include Xtreme features depending on version
- **Note**: Momentum merged Xtreme, so both are treated as same target

### RogueMaster Firmware
- **NFC Stack**: Custom modifications, occasional parsing differences
- **HID**: Custom HID stack, minor timing differences
- **Build System**: Most complex, includes many plugins
- **Recommendation**: Test thoroughly on this firmware, quirks are common

---

## Minimum Firmware Versions

To ensure compatibility, users should have:

- **Official**: 0.105.0 or higher
- **Unleashed**: 0.105.0-based release or higher
- **Momentum**: 0.105.0-based release or higher
- **RogueMaster**: 0.105.0-based release or higher

Older firmware versions are **not supported** and may crash or behave unexpectedly.

## Future Firmware Updates

### Monitoring Strategy

1. **Subscribe to firmware repos**:
   - github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware
   - github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware
   - github.com/Next-Flip/Momentum-Firmware
   - github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins

2. **Check for releases**: Weekly
3. **Build against dev branches**: Monthly
4. **Update compatibility matrix**: After each app release

### Expected Breaking Changes

Watch for these potential API changes in future firmware updates:

**High Risk** (likely to break):
- NFC poller API refactoring
- HID profile system changes
- Storage API version bumps

**Medium Risk**:
- GUI widget API updates
- Scene manager changes
- Notification system refactoring

**Low Risk**:
- Cosmetic API renames (with deprecation warnings)
- New optional features
- Performance optimizations
